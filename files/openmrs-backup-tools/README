OpenMRS Backup Tools
=============================================================

This is a little collection of bash scripts which can:

* Read database connection details from OpenMRS runtime properties
* Dump database as daily, weekly or monthly
* Expire daily, weekly or monthly dumps
* Record everything to /var/log/syslog
* Sync to a USB device

Requires:
* pmount, usbmount (for USB syncing)

Setup:

1. Edit backup.conf and provide the paths for
    * Your OpenMRS runtime properties file
    * The destination directory for backups

2. Add cron job to execute openmrs_backup.sh by running "sudo crontab -e". E.g.

# m h  dom mon dow   command
@midnight ~/openmrs_backup.sh
